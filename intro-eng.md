# Using Jupyter Notebooks in the Humanities and Social Sciences

## Introduction

This document is an article on the use of Jupyter Notebooks in the Humanities and Social Sciences. It consists of three parts:

1. Summary: Advantages, Disadvantages and Best Practices for Jupyter Notebooks in the Humanities and Social Sciences.
2. Jupyter Notebook example: HAL API query.
3. Survey of digital practices in the Humanities and Social Sciences.

## Part 1 : Summary

The first part of this article provides a summary of the advantages, disadvantages and best practices for using Jupyter Notebooks in the Humanities and Social Sciences. We will examine how Jupyter Notebooks can facilitate the explanation and reproducibility of analyses, as well as the potential challenges associated with using this approach.

## Part 2 : Example of a Jupyter Notebook

Part 2 presents a concrete example of the use of Jupyter Notebooks in the Humanities and Social Sciences. We will explore how to query the API of HAL, an open archive database, to obtain information on researchers' digital practices. This Jupyter Notebook will be used as an illustration to show the best practices to be implemented in the creation of this type of document.

## Part 3 : Survey of digital practices

The third part of this article presents a survey carried out among human and social scientists to find out about their digital practices.
