# Using Jupyter Notebooks in Social Sciences

## Introduction

This article discusses the utilization of Jupyter Notebooksin in Social Sciences. It consists of three parts:

1. Advantages, Disadvantages and Best Practices for Jupyter Notebooks in Social Sciences.
2. Example of a Jupyter Notebook with the HAL API.
3. Questionnaire about digital practices in Social Sciences.

## Part 1 : Summary

The first part of this article provides a summary of the advantages, disadvantages and best practices for the utilization of Jupyter Notebooks in Social Sciences field. We will examine how Jupyter Notebooks can facilitate the explanation and reproducibility of analyses, as well as the potential challenges associated with using this approach.

## Part 2 : Example of a Jupyter Notebook

Part 2 presents a concrete example of using Jupyter Notebooks in Social Sciences. We will explore how to query HAL's API, an open archive database, to obtain informations on researchers' digital practices. This Jupyter Notebook will be used as an illustration to show the best practices to be implemented in the creation of this type of document.

## Part 3 : Survey of digital practices

The third part of this article presents a survey carried out among social scientists to find out about their digital practices.
